                    <p style="text-indent: 50px;">Tonight, officially marks the beginning on my journey on being someone you loved. We already made our final farewells and we ended our relationship properly. You decided to cease contact with me, and I completely understand. But a part of me still wants to talk to you, unfortunately I can’t anymore. And being the last to chat actually made me feel a little better, I don’t really know why but it did.</p>
                    <p>It was so hard to accept everything then, but I promise I’ll be okay. I really am gonna miss you, I’m just glad you made me feel that you were mine again, even for a little while, even if it wasn’t real. That smile, that laugh, those eyes, those moments, will become memories and I’ll keep them in my heart. That made me cry HAHAAHHAHAHA, but back to work. It just hurts that when I looked back, you weren’t there. You know, I actually looked back 4 times before going, and it hurt more and more every time. But I guess it’s for the greater good.
                    </p> 
                    <p>I can’t stop blaming myself for everything that happened. All those things I could have done differently, the words I could have said to fix things, to do what was needed to keep you mine.  But I failed, I failed miserably, and I apologize for that. 
                    </p>
                    <p>I just hope now, you’ll finally find the happiness you deserve, the one that I couldn’t give to you. I hope the best for the both of you, it just feels heavy knowing that you already moved on with someone new, but I am happy for you. 
                    </p>
                    <p>This pain, this heartache, the feeling of letting someone go hoping that they’ll come back, maybe that’s what they call love. I just hope destiny favors me just one time.
                    </p>
                    <p>That is all for now, goodbye.</p>

            <div class="dropdown-content" id="dropdown2">
                <h3 class="header">Day 2</h3>
                <h5 class="subheader">December 24, 2024</h5>
                    <p>It felt like time goes by really slow, I could feel every second of the day. And yet I find myself thinking about you. Looping around what had been and what could have been. So many “what if’s” had come to my mind, all leading to one definite outcome, me and you apart. But I always tell myself that there is more to this story than meets the eye, it couldn’t end like this, it shouldn’t end like this. I know to myself that it’s not the end yet, it’s just my turn to wait.</p>
	                <p>The urge of reaching out to you is tremendous, I just miss every part of you. I know you’re disappointed on how late it is for me to realize everything, I deeply apologize. But I know you don’t have anything to do with me anymore, so thank you for ignoring me. Maybe you restricted me or put me on silent, or maybe archived my chats, I don’t know how you do it but good for you. I already did this to you and I know you’ve experienced this, and damn it hurts like hell.</p>
	                <p>I tried to distract myself from the pain with chores, games or even sleeping, but the heartache is so great I feel like I can’t move. I feel myself begging for you to come back to me, as so you did, now I finally understand how it feels. Love is really something isn’t it. Someone told all those which you believe in, true love, soul mates, destiny, all those fairytale fantasies aren’t real, a small part of me actually agrees with that. But I chose to believe it, whatever it is they would say. I just didn’t realize how easy it is to unlove me, until now.</p>
